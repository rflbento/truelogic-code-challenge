# Truelogic Code Challenge

Hi! My name is Rafael Bento and this is the Truelogic Code Challenge.

Here you will find how I solved its challenge using pure ruby.

Next you can check how to run the code and see the results.

## Dependencies

- Any ruby version (in my case, I used version `2.0.0`, so you can install a more recent version).

## How to check

1. Clone this repo in your coumputer (or download only the files `.rb` and `.dat` if you prefer);
2. Open your terminal;
3. Access the directory where you downloaded the files.

### Weather challenge

To check the result, just run:

```shell
ruby weather_challenge.rb w_data.dat
```

### Soccer challenge

To check the result, just run:

```shell
ruby soccer_challenge.rb soccer.dat
```

That's it! Thank you for considering me and I hope you like the logic I've implemented to solve these challenges.

See ya!
